ðŸ§¿ Ledger Vision

See every token you own across all wallets & chains in one secure Ledger Live Dapp.

Documentation feedback :
- The doc was really large but covered every parts of what Ledger can offer to a developer.
- Probably better navigation menus would be cool, I used mostly Ledger Services kit I found in the homepage and later had to find my way to Ledger Live docs.
- Also a react/next.js Ledger Dapp boilerplate with simple useAccounts and sign would be cool.
- Except from that it was really smooth.
- Maybe also a few examples of what can be built with each documentation link needed would be nice.

Small typo :

setion instead of section
